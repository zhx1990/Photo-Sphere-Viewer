::: tip Cropped panoramas
If your image is not covering a full 360°×180° sphere, it will be deformed. You can fix it by providing [cropping data](./cropped-panorama.md).
:::

::: tip Caching
Previous version of Photo Sphere Viewer had a caching system, which was buggy and thus disabled by default.

Photo Sphere Viewer 4 uses [THREE.js Cache](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/loaders/Cache), enabled by default. You can disable this cache by calling `THREE.Cache.enabled = false;` after importing Photo Sphere Viewer.
