# Cubemap projection

[Cube mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube_mapping) is a kind of projection where the environment is mapped to the six faces of a cube arround the viewer.

Photo Sphere Viewer supports cubemaps as six distinct image files. The files can be provided as [an object or an array](./config.md#panorama-required).

All features of Photo Sphere Viewer are fully supported when using cubemaps but the `fisheye` option gives funky results.
